## Introduction
Hi, I’m Gurpreet I am an undergraduate student at NIT Jalandhar.  I learn about Data Science and Machine Learning. I like to analyze and visualize data to make better and more informed business decisions. When I am not cleaning or working with data I would probably be listening to Beach House music
