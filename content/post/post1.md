According to me, Internet of Things is the next big thing in AI because of the huge volume of data in various formats, from various sources, and from different hardware, as well as the complexity of the processing needed to sift through all of this data, extract the relevant information, and make a decision. As Moore's Law continues to drive advancements in technology, we will see more and more data available that can be analyzed and the complexity of analysis increase. As the amount of data and the amount of real-time decision making increase, the ability to find meaningful insights and predict outcomes based on this data will become even more important.
