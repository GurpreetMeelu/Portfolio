## Introduction
Cricket is a popular sport in India. It is also one of the most popular sports in the world. The game involves two teams of eleven players each. The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins. In this project, we use machine learning to predict the final score of a cricket match

In this project, we use regression techniques to predict the score of a cricket match. We use data from the 2019-2020 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to train our model. The model predicts the score of a match based on the teams, the venue, and the toss.

##  Dataset Description:

- **mid**: Each match is given a unique number
- **date**: When the match happened
- **venue**: The stadium where match is being played
- **bat_team**: Batting team name
- **bowl_team**: Bowling team name
- **batsman**: Batsman name who faced that ball
- **bowler**: Bowler who bowled that ball
- **runs**: Total runs scored by team at that instance
- **wickets**: Total wickets fallen at that instance
- **overs**: Total overs bowled at that instance
- **runs_last_5**: Total runs scored in last 5 overs
- **wickets_last_5**: Total wickets that fell in last 5 overs
- **striker**: max(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)
- **non-striker**: min(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)
- **total**: Total runs scored by batting team after first innings
