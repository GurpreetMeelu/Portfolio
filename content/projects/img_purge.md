The idea behind this project is declutter all the images of notes after the exam. Before the exam you have lot of images of notes in your directory and you have to manually delete them after the exam which are in mix with your regular images.

The goal of this aims to help users organize their digital photo collections by automatically identifying and removing images of notes. This can be a tedious and time-consuming process when done manually, especially if the user has a large number of photos on their device.

Using a deep learning model, Image Purge can accurately classify an image as a note or not, allowing the user to automatically delete the unnecessary photos with a simple Python script. This can help free up valuable storage space on the user's device and make it easier to find and access the photos they want to keep.

To use Image Purge, the user simply needs to provide a folder containing their photos to the Python script. The script will then use the deep learning model to classify the images and delete any that are identified as notes.

Overall, Image Purge is a convenient and effective way to declutter a digital photo collection and make it more organized and manageable. By using the latest advances in deep learning, it can accurately identify and remove unwanted images with minimal effort on the part of the user.
