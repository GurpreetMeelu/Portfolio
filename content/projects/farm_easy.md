Soil Health is a bigger problem for the farmers as it affects the crop productivity and the soil quality indirectly affects the health of the citizens. The biggest problem for the farmers is to get the accurate information about their soil and grow a crop that is suitable for their soil. So, we have come up with a solution to this problem. We have developed a web application that will help the farmers to get the accurate information about their soil and also suggest them the best crop to grow in their soil.

### Fearures:
1. Recommnedation of the best crop to grow in the soil.
2. Recommendation of the best fertilizer to use in the soil.
