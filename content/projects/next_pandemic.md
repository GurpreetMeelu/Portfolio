## Introduction
In this project, we will use the News API to gather news data related to viral outbreaks and pandemics. We will then use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract the cities and countries mentioned in the headlines of the news articles. This information will be used to create a dataset of cities and countries that have been mentioned in relation to viral outbreaks.

Next, we will use clustering algorithms to identify patterns in the data and find clusters of cities and countries that may be at a higher risk for the next viral pandemic. These clusters can be used by public health officials to better prepare for and respond to potential pandemics by providing targeted interventions and support in areas that are at a higher risk.

The results of this project will be presented in the form of visualizations and reports, which can be used by public health officials and other stakeholders to better understand the potential risks and take appropriate action to prevent and respond to future pandemics
