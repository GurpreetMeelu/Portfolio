## Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of tracking and predicting pandemics in general. In this project, we use text clustering to analyze news data. The goal of the project is to find the next viral pandemic. To achieve this, we scrap health-related news from NewsAPI from all around the world and then use machine learning techniques like clustering to find patterns. We then use these patterns to predict the next pandemic.
